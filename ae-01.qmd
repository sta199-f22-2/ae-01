## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# UN Votes

For the remainder of class, we are going to look at the voting history of countries in the United Nations General Assembly using data from package **unvotes** (and start getting familiar with R along the way).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(DT)
library(viridis)
library(unvotes)
```

# Data

We will work with three data sets: un_roll_calls, un_roll_call_issues, and un_votes. Each data set contains a variable called rcid, the roll call id, which can be used to join the data sets with one another.

-- The un_votes data set provides information on the voting history of the United Nations General Assembly. It contains one row for each country/vote pair.

```{r}
un_votes
```

Create a new code chunk below and use the function *View* on the un_votes data set. Run the code. You should see a new window pop it where you can clearly see the entire data set. 

Create another new code chunk. Practice pulling out columns of the data set with the *$* sign. Pull out the *vote* column. In a seperate line of code, pull out *country_code* 

The un_roll_calls data set contains information on each roll call vote of the United Nations General Assembly.

```{r}
un_roll_calls
```

The un_roll_call_issues data set contains issue classifications of roll call votes of the United Nations General Assembly. There are many votes that have no issue classification, and some are classified under more than one issue.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
un_roll_call_issues
```

# Analysis

## Part 1

We begin by looking at how often each country voted "yes" on a resolution in each year. How could we visualize the percentage of yes's for the US, Ghana, Mexico, and France?

The goal of this exercise is NOT for you to learn every function perfectly. We are training are braing to think critically about code. 

```{r}
#| message: false
country_list <- c("United States", "Ghana", "Mexico", "France")
un_votes |>
  filter(country %in% country_list) |>
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") |> 
  group_by(year = year(date), country) |>
  summarize(votes = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == "yes")) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = percent_yes, color = country)) +
    geom_line() +
    ylab("% of votes that are 'Yes'") +
  scale_color_viridis_d() 
```

Consider the plot from Part 1. Describe how the voting behaviors of the four countries have changed over time.
